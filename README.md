A simple project for copying text to your clipboard effortlessly.

## Why?

1. Browser Autofill sucks. It's a pain to fill out forms, and often times it ruins what I entered manually.

2. As a keyboard heavy person, I would rely on keyboard shortcuts but that solution is not feasible when you have too many things to copy.
3. Clipboard managers are great, but they're again too many clicks and I like to see things as per my own taste and hence Shadcn UI.

## How to Use (replace `pnpm` with `npm` as needed)

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate into the directory.
3. Run `pnpm install` (or `npm install` if you prefer).
4. Modify the text in `text-items.json` to your liking.
5. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`.
6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`.

Depending on your operating system, resize the window, pin it to a corner of your screen, and set it to 'Always on top' for easy access.

I primarily use Ubuntu, and if you manage to get this working on your OS, feel free to contribute to this README!

## How I use it

I keep this thing open in the background, and I use it to copy text to my clipboard. I've found it to be a lifesaver for me, and I hope it helps you too!
